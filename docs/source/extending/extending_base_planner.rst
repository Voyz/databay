Extending BasePlanner
=====================

Databay comes with two implementations of BasePlanner - :any:`ApsPlanner` and :any:`SchedulePlanner`. If you require custom scheduling functionality outside of these two interfaces, you can create your own implementation of :any:`BasePlanner`. Have a look at the two existing implementations for reference: `ApsPlanner <../_modules/databay/planners/aps_planner.html>`_ and `SchedulePlanner <../_modules/databay/planners/schedule_planner.html>`_.

To extend the :any:`BasePlanner` you need to provide a way of executing :any:`Link.transfer` method repeatedly by implementing the following methods. Note that some of these methods are private since they are called internally by BasePlanner and should not be executed directly.

_schedule
---------

Schedule a :any:`Link`. This method runs whenever :any:`add_links` is called and should not be executed directly. It should accept a link and add the :any:`Link.transfer` method to the scheduling system you're using. Note that you do not need to store the link in your planner - BasePlanner will automatically store it under :any:`BasePlanner.links` when :any:`add_links` is called. It isn't required for the scheduling to be already running when :code:`_schedule` is called.

Each link comes with a :any:`datetime.timedelta` interval providing the frequency at which its :any:`Link.transfer` method should be run. Use :any:`Link.interval` and schedule according to the interval specified.

If the scheduler you're using utilises some form of task-managing job objects, you must assign these to the link being scheduled using :any:`Link.set_job`. This is to ensure the job can be correctly destroyed later when :any:`remove_links <BasePlanner.remove_links>` is called.

Example from :code:`ApsPlanner._schedule`:

.. code-block:: python

    def _schedule(self, link:Link):
        job = self._scheduler.add_job(link.transfer,
            trigger=IntervalTrigger(seconds=link.interval.total_seconds()))

        link.set_job(job)



_unschedule
-----------

Unschedule a :any:`Link`. This method runs whenever :any:`remove_links` is called and should not be executed directly. It should accept a link and remove it from the scheduling system you're using. Note that you do not need to remove the link from your planner - BasePlanner will automatically remove that link from :any:`BasePlanner.links` when :any:`remove_links` is called. It isn't required for the scheduling to be already stopped when :code:`_unschedule` is called.

If the scheduler you're using utilises some form of task-managing job objects, you may access these using :any:`Link.job` in order to correctly destroy them if necessary when :code:`_unschedule` is called.

Example from :code:`ApsPlanner._unschedule`:

.. code-block:: python

    def _unschedule(self, link:Link):
        if link.job is not None:
            link.job.remove()
            link.set_job(None)

_start_planner
--------------

Start the scheduling. This method runs whenever :any:`BasePlanner.start` is called and should not be executed directly. It should begin the scheduling of links.

This method will be called just after all :any:`Inlet.on_start` and :any:`Outlet.on_start` are called.

Example from :code:`ApsPlanner._start_planner`:

.. code-block:: python

    def _start_planner(self):
        self._scheduler.start()

_shutdown_planner
-----------------

Shutdown the scheduling. This method runs whenever :any:`BasePlanner.shutdown` is called and should not be executed directly. It should shut down the scheduling of links.

A :code:`wait` parameter is provided that you can pass down to your scheduling system if it allows waiting for the remaining jobs to complete before shutting down.

This method will be called just before all :any:`Inlet.on_shutdown` and :any:`Outlet.on_shutdown` are called.

Example from :code:`ApsPlanner._shutdown_planner`:

.. code-block:: python

    def _shutdown_planner(self, wait:bool=True):
        self._scheduler.shutdown(wait=wait)


Running property
----------------

:any:`BasePlanner.running <BasePlanner.running>` property should return a boolean value indicating whether the scheduler is currently running. By default this property always returns True.

Exceptions
----------

When implementing your planner you should consider that links may raise exceptions when executing. Your planner should anticipate this and allow handling the exceptions appropriately to ensure continuous execution. BasePlanner exposes a protected :code:`BasePlanner._on_exception` method that can be called to handle the exception, allowing to ignore exceptions when :code:`ignore_exceptions=True` is passed on construction. Otherwise the exceptions will be logged and the planner will attempt a graceful shutdown. Both :any:`ApsPlanner` and :any:`SchedulePlanner` support this behaviour by default. See :ref:`Exception handling <exception_handling>` for more.


Immediate transfer on start
---------------------------

By default BasePlanner will execute :any:`Link.transfer` function on all its links once upon calling :any:`BasePlanner.start`. This is to avoid having to wait for the link's interval to expire before the first transfer. You can disable this behaviour by passing :code:`immediate_transfer=False` parameter on construction of the :any:`BasePlanner` to disable it for all governed links or individually for selected links by setting their :code:`immediate_transfer` to :code:`False`.


Shutdown atexit
---------------

Each :any:`BasePlanner` registers an :any:`atexit` callback, which will attempt to gracefully shut the planner down if it is created with :any:`shutdown_at_exit <BasePlanner>` parameter set to :code:`True`.
